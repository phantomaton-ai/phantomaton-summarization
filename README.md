# Phantomaton Summarization üîç

The Phantomaton Summarization module extends the Phantomaton conversational framework with automated summarization capabilities. This allows Phantomaton-powered conversations to maintain context and provide succinct recaps as the dialog progresses, preventing information overload and ensuring smooth, long-running interactions.

## Features üîß

- **Automatic Summarization**: The Summarization module seamlessly integrates with the Phantomaton Conversations component, generating summaries of the conversation at configurable intervals.
- **Customizable Summarization**: The content and format of the summaries can be customized through configuration options and extension points.

## Usage üõ†Ô∏è

To use the Phantomaton Summarization module, you'll need to install it as a dependency in your Phantomaton-based application:

npm install phantomaton-summarization
```

Once installed, you can configure and integrate the Summarization module with your Phantomaton application's prompt:

```markdown
/install phantomaton-conversations
/install phantomaton-summarization

You are a friendy chatbot with summarization capabilities.
```

## Configuration ü§ñ

This plugin accepts the following configuration options:

* `turns`: The maximum number of turns to send to an assistant in their unsummarized form.
* `message`: The message to send to the assistant when requesting summarization.

## Extensibility üîå

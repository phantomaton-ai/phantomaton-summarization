# Phantomaton Summarization üîç

The Phantomaton Summarization module extends the Phantomaton conversational framework with automated summarization capabilities. This allows Phantomaton-powered conversations to maintain context and provide succinct recaps as the dialog progresses, preventing information overload and ensuring smooth, long-running interactions.

## Features üîß

- **Automatic Summarization**: The Summarization module seamlessly integrates with the Phantomaton Conversations component, generating summaries of the conversation at configurable intervals.
- **Customizable Summarization**: The content and format of the summaries can be customized through configuration options and extension points.
- **Conversation State Preservation**: The generated summaries are stored as part of the conversation state, allowing the conversation to be resumed from any point without loss of context.
- **Extensibility**: The Summarization module is designed to be easily extended and integrated with other Phantomaton components, enabling advanced use cases.

## Usage üõ†Ô∏è

To use the Phantomaton Summarization module, you'll need to install it as a dependency in your Phantomaton-based application:

```bash
npm install phantomaton-summarization
```

Once installed, you can configure and integrate the Summarization module with your Phantomaton application:

```javascript
import summarization from 'phantomaton-summarization';
import conversations from 'phantomaton-conversations';

const container = summarization.create({
  // Provide any necessary configuration options
});

// Integrate the Summarization module with Phantomaton Conversations
const [getConversation] = container.resolve(conversations.conversation.resolve);
const conversation = getConversation();
```

## Extensibility üîå

The Phantomaton Summarization module is designed to be highly extensible. You can create custom summarization strategies, integrate with external services, or extend the module's functionality in other ways by implementing the appropriate extension points.
